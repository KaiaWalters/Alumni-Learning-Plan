Week 4 
TOPIC: Functional Programing
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.
Pure functions
Function composition
Avoid shared state
Avoid mutating state
Avoid side effects

Week 7 : Relational Databases:
Topic: language for examples should be SQL because of popularity
What a Relational Database Is
Data Consistency
Commitment and Atomicity
Stored Procedures and Relational Databases
Database Locking and Concurrency

A relational database is a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. The standard user and application programming interface (API) of a relational database is the Structured Query Language (SQL).
The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data in a tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files. ... The relationships between these data values will be stored in the form of a table as well. Every value stored in the relational database is accessible.

Week 11
Topic: Dynamic programming part 2 memoization & tabulation 
What is memoization?										Memoization ensures that a method doesn't run for the same inputs more than once by keeping a record of the results for the given inputs (usually in a hash map).
to avoid redundancy can wrap the method in a class that stores an instance variable, memo, that maps inputs to outputs. Then we simply check memo to see if we can avoid computing the answer for any given input, and
save the results of any calculations to memo.

What is tribulation? 
. A tabulation algorithm focuses on filling the entries of the cache, until the target value has been reached..
If the original problem requires all subproblems to be solved, tabulation usually outperforms memoization by a constant factor. This is because tabulation has no overhead for recursion and can use a preallocated array rather than, say, a hash map.
What is the difference?
To summarize, the major differences between tabulation and memoization are: tabulation has to look through the entire search space; memoization does not. tabulation requires careful ordering of the subproblems is; memoization doesn't care much about the order of recursive calls.

Time complexity difference form recursion
  fact enough to bring down the complexity from O(2n) to O(n).
